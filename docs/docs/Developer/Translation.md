# Translating BookLogr Into Your Language

BookLogr supports localization through simple translation files. Each language has its own file stored in the project directory. This guide walks you through the steps to translate BookLogr into your preferred language.

---

## How to translate
Language files are located in `web/src/locales`
Each language has it's own subfolder named after their respective language code (e.g. `en` for English, `sv` for Swedish). Inside, youâ€™ll find a `.json` file containing the translation keys and values.

1. **Locate the Language File**
   - Navigate to `web/src/locales/<language_code>/<language_code>.json`
   - For example, English is stored at:  
     `web/src/locales/en/en.json`
2. **Edit the File**
   - Each entry is structured as a key-value pair.
   - **Translate only the value**, not the key.

#### Example: Original English
```json
{
    "reading_status": {
    "read": "Read",
    "currently_reading": "Currently reading",
    "to_be_read": "To be read"
    }
}
```

#### Example: Translated to Swedish
```json
{
  "reading_status": {
    "read": "LÃ¤st",
    "currently_reading": "LÃ¤ser just nu",
    "to_be_read": "Att lÃ¤sa"
  }
}
```
:::warning
Do **not** change the keys. These are used internally by the appplication and should not be modified or translated.
:::

To finish your translation contribution, the last thing you should do is commit your changes and open a pull request on the [projects GitHub page](https://github.com/mozzo1000/booklogr) so they can be merged into the project. That way, your work becomes part of the appâ€™s official language support.

# Adding a new language

This guide walks developers through the process of adding a new language to the BookLogr project.

:::tip
If you are a translator and would like to contribute a new language to the project. Reach by opening an [issue](https://github.com/mozzo1000/booklogr) and requesting a new language to be added.
:::

:::warning
Always use `en.json` as the base translation file when adding a new language. This ensures consistency in the translation keys across all languages.
:::
---

## 1. Create the language file
Add a new language folder in `web/src/locales` using the language code (e.g. `fr` for French) and copy the English translation as the base:

```bash
mkdir -p web/src/locales/fr
cp web/src/locales/en/en.json web/src/locales/fr/fr.json
```

## 2. Update `i18n.jsx`
1. Open the file `web/src/i18n.jsx` and import the new language translation file.
2. Add it to the `resources` object so it is included in the `react-i18next` configuration.

For example, if you're adding French (`fr`):

```jsx
import en from "./locales/en/en.json";
import sv from "./locales/sv/sv.json";
import fr from "./locales/fr/fr.json";

const resources = {
  en: { translation: en },
  sv: { translation: sv },
  fr: { translation: fr }
};
```

## 3. Update the Language Switcher Component
To make the new language selectable in the web interface, 
open the file `web/src/components/LanguageSwitcher.jsx`  and add a new object to the `languages` array. 

For example, to add French (`fr`):
```jsx
const languages = [
  { code: "en", label: "English", flag: "ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§" },
  { code: "sv", label: "Svenska", flag: "ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª" },
  { code: "fr", label: "FranÃ§ais", flag: "ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·" }
];
```
- `code`: Must match the language code used in `i18n.jsx`.
- `label`: Display name shown in the dropdown menu.
- `flag`: Emoji for the country's flag.

ðŸŽ‰ You can now edit the new language file in `web/src/locales`.
